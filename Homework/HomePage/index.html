    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        Ever since I can remember, I've been enchanted by the captivating stories, the artful designs, and the intricate interactions that games offer. They've been both my refuge and my inspiration, sparking my creativity and fueling my desire to become a game developer.
        <br>
        <br>
        My journey into the realm of game design has been an adventure in itself. As a nontraditional student, I've had my fair share of experience in other fields such as Social Studies, Engineering, and Video Production. I am fully committed to pursue my passion and intrinsically motivated to push the boundaries of this industry.
        <br>
        <br>
        Whether you're a fellow gamer, creator, or simply curious about the magic of games, feel free to explore my work and join me on this journey. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Thanks for visiting!
