    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of my site is to practice using CSS and appeal to fans of retro "PSX" games.
        I chose this design because I thought it would be challenging to implement using CSS grid.
        (turns out I was right!)

    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Lessons Learned & Other Notes</h2>
    <h3>Phase 1:</h3>
    <p>
        I quickly discovered that only using a single grid wouldn't be enough and that in order to
        manipulate each element I would need to use grids-within-grids (gridception).
        While this allowed me to accomplish what I wanted, it also made organization a nightmare.
        Luckily, I found a website (Layoutit!) that lets you plan out CSS grid areas and I constantly
        referenced a screenshot of the layout I made using it.
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition, many of the content areas in the design are not alligned perfectly and therefore
        do not fit perfectly into a grid. I discovered that I could use negative margin values and different
        positioning types in order to offset content, but this was a very time consuming process of trial and error.
        <br>
        <br>
        There were a few things I could not figure out, such as how to get the text in the "Characters & Things That Go
        Boom" section
        to continue under the image, and I also would have liked to make the background look better if I had more time.
        That being said, I learned
        a ton of new things about HTML/CSS such as the "::first_letter" selector which allowed me to make the W in the
        intro section stand out and adding shadows to titles using "text-shadow".
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, while it's not perfect, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish with this design!
    </p>

    <br>

    <h3>Phase 2:</h3>
    <p>
        I really enjoyed stylizing my page to fit the content, and I think that it turned out great visually!
        <br>
        <br>
        Making the navigation bar was much easier than I thought it would be. By refering to the code I wrote for one 
        of the tetris exercises, I was even able to animate the "buttons" when they are hovered over.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, making the page responsive for mobile was a bit of a nightmare. I mostly blame myself, since I used a 
        ton of pixel values for the original design. That being said, I think the structure of the page itself made 
        implementing responsiveness difficult due to using grids-within-grids and grids/sections that are intentionally
        not alligned with one another. I had to change a number of style rules for each individual section's grid (and subgrids) 
        since they were using properties such as negative margins and had images placed in different areas with different sizes. This turned out to be
        an extremely time consuming process of trial and error, but I did end up with a mobile breakpoint that keeps all of the original
        content (okay, I did hide one image in the last section in order to make a symmetrical grid of images).
        <br>
        <br>
        Although I'm happy with my mobile layout, I admit that I ran out of time to fully implement responsiveness at any width.
        I managed to implement some responsiveness at any width, however, I would likely had to completely remake my original 
        page using relative values in order for it to work at any width, and I simply did not have time. I did learn a 
        valuble lesson though - don't hardcode pixel values into your layout!!!
