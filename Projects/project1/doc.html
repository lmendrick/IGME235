    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of my site is to practice using CSS and appeal to fans of retro "PSX" games.
        I chose this design because I thought it would be challenging to implement using CSS grid.
        (turns out I was right!)

    <h2>Lessons Learned & Other Notes</h2>
    <p>
        I quickly discovered that only using a single grid wouldn't be enough and that in order to
        manipulate each element I would need to use grids-within-grids (gridception).
        While this allowed me to accomplish what I wanted, it also made organization a nightmare.
        Luckily, I found a website (Layoutit!) that lets you plan out CSS grid areas and I constantly
        referenced a screenshot of the layout I made using it.
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition, many of the content areas in the design are not alligned perfectly and therefore
        do not fit perfectly into a grid. I discovered that I could use negative margin values and different
        positioning types in order to offset content, but this was a very time consuming process of trial and error.
        <br>
        <br>
        There were a few things I could not figure out, such as how to get the text in the "Characters & Things That Go
        Boom" section
        to continue under the image, and I also would have liked to make the background look better if I had more time.
        That being said, I learned
        a ton of new things about HTML/CSS such as the "::first_letter" selector which allowed me to make the W in the
        intro section stand out and adding shadows to titles using "text-shadow".
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, while it's not perfect, I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish with this design!
